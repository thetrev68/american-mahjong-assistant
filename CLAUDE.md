## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
This is a **local network multiplayer web application** for assisting in-person American Mahjong games with an **intelligent co-pilot system**. It creates a digital overlay for physical gameplay with AI-powered pattern analysis and recommendations.

**Key Principle**: Players use phones as intelligent co-pilots while playing with physical tiles and boards. The architecture has been transformed from auto-pilot to co-pilot, giving players control while providing intelligent assistance.

### Core Components

#### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **React 18** with **TypeScript** and **Vite**
- **Zustand** for modern state management with devtools
- **Tailwind CSS** for mobile-first responsive design with modern design system
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Feature-based architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- Progressive Web App capabilities

#### Backend (`/backend`) 
- **Express** server with **Socket.io** for WebSocket communication
- **TypeScript** with **ts-node** for development
- **In-memory storage** (no database)
- **CORS configured** for local network access

#### Intelligence Layer (`/intelligence`)
- **NMJL 2025 Pattern Data** - Authentic National Mah Jongg League patterns
- **Analysis Engines** - Pattern matching and recommendation systems
- **Preserved Legacy Code** - Working analysis engines moved to `/legacy`

### Modern Co-Pilot Architecture

The application follows a **co-pilot pattern** where AI provides intelligent assistance while users maintain full control:

#### State Management (Zustand)
- **Game Store** - Room, player, and game phase management
- **UI Store** - User preferences, themes, and tutorial state  
- **Pattern Store** - Pattern selection, filtering, and progress tracking

#### Feature-Based Organization

### Important Development Patterns

#### Co-Pilot vs Auto-Pilot
- **Co-Pilot**: AI provides suggestions, user makes decisions
- **Pattern Selection**: User chooses target patterns explicitly
- **Recommendations**: AI suggests keep/pass/discard with reasoning
- **Control**: User maintains full agency over all game decisions

#### Modern State Management
- **Zustand** over Redux for simplicity and performance
- **Feature-based** stores instead of monolithic state
- **TypeScript-first** with proper type inference
- **Devtools integration** for debugging

#### Component Architecture  
- **Feature folders** group related components, stores, and logic
- **UI components** are pure, reusable building blocks
- **Mobile-first** responsive design with touch optimization
- **Accessibility** built into all interactive elements

#### Design System
- **Purple/Blue palette** (#6366F1 primary, #3B82F6 secondary) 
- **Glassmorphism effects** with backdrop blur and subtle borders
- **Modern animations** with respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom utility classes and component patterns

### Development Considerations

#### Privacy & Data Flow
- **Client-side pattern analysis** - All AI processing stays local
- **Private tile data** never sent to other players
- **Shared game state** for coordination (discards, phases, etc.)
- **User preference persistence** with localStorage

#### Performance & Scalability
- **Lazy loading** of pattern data and components
- **Efficient re-renders** with proper Zustand selectors
- **Mobile optimization** for touch devices and smaller screens
- **Progressive enhancement** with graceful degradation

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Comprehensive error boundaries** for component failures
- **Loading states** for all async operations
- **Network resilience** with retry mechanisms
- **User feedback** for all error conditions

### NMJL 2025 Pattern Integration

#### Data Source
- **Authentic NMJL Data**: `nmjl-card-2025.json` contains all 71 official patterns
- **Complete Pattern Details**: ID, description, points, difficulty, groups, joker rules
- **Validation & Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces with runtime validation

#### Pattern Selection System
- **Interactive Cards**: Touch-friendly pattern cards with visual indicators
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by difficulty, points, jokers, sections
- **Multiple Targets**: Users can star patterns they're considering
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual completion percentage for selected patterns

#### Intelligence Features (Future)
- **Pattern Matching**: Analyze current hand against all possible patterns
- **Completion Probability**: Calculate likelihood of completing each pattern
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Suggest keep/pass based on pattern requirements
- **Charleston Integration**: Pass recommendations considering target patterns

### Configuration Files
- `frontend/postcss.config.js` - Tailwind CSS with PostCSS setup
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Design system configuration
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Vite development and build settings
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript strict mode configuration
- `backend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler options for Node.js

### Testing Strategy

#### Testing Priorities (Immediate Implementation)
1. **Store Testing** - Zustand stores (pattern, intelligence, tile)
2. **Service Testing** - NMJL service, analysis engine  
3. **Component Testing** - UI components with user interactions
4. **Integration Testing** - Full user flows (pattern selection → tile input)

#### Test Structure
- `__tests__/` folders alongside source files
- `.test.tsx` for components, `.test.ts` for logic
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, localStorage)

#### Testing Implementation
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for UI components
- **Store Testing**: Direct Zustand store testing without mocking
- **Integration Testing**: Feature-level testing with user flows
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-device testing on actual mobile devices

## Important Instructions

### Code Quality Standards
- **ESLint**: Run `npm run lint` before any commit - must show 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance required - no `any` types without justification
- **Pre-commit Checks**: Always run lint + build + test before commits
- **Import Cleanup**: Remove unused imports immediately
- **Consistent Type Usage**: Use proper union types instead of `any` assertions
- **Testing**: All new features require corresponding tests

### Development Workflow
1. **Architecture First**: Understand existing patterns before adding features
2. **Quality Gates**: ESLint + TypeScript + Tests must pass
3. **Incremental Commits**: Small, focused commits with clear messages
4. **Code Review**: Use TodoWrite tool for progress tracking
5. **Consolidation**: Regular cleanup of duplicates and unused code

### Current Architecture Status (Post-Consolidation)
- ✅ **Type System**: Unified in `/shared/nmjl-types.ts`
- ✅ **Analysis Engine**: Single working engine in `/services/analysis-engine.ts`
- ✅ **State Management**: Clean Zustand stores with proper typing
- ✅ **Component Hierarchy**: Simplified Tile → TileSprite relationship
- ✅ **Code Quality**: 0 ESLint errors/warnings, strict TypeScript
- 🔄 **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite implementation in progress

### File Organization
- **NEVER** move files from `legacy/` - they contain working systems
- **ALWAYS** create new files in the modern architecture folders
- **PREFER** editing existing files over creating new ones
- **NEVER** create markdown documentation files unless explicitly requested
- **Co-locate tests** with source files in `__tests__/` folders

### Development Approach
- **Follow the chunk plan** with current focus on testing infrastructure
- **Complete chunks fully** before moving to the next
- **Test thoroughly** on mobile devices and different screen sizes
- **Maintain TypeScript strict mode** compliance
- **Use TodoWrite tool** proactively for progress tracking
- **Write tests alongside feature development** (not after)

### Code Style & Quality
- **No comments** unless explicitly requested
- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript** patterns (async/await, destructuring, etc.)
- **Functional components** with hooks over class components
- **Consistent naming** following existing patterns
- **Mobile-first** responsive design principles

This co-pilot architecture provides a solid foundation for building an intelligent American Mahjong assistant that enhances rather than replaces the social in-person gaming experience.
