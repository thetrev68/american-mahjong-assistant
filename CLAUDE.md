# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Frontend (React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Zustand)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev        # Start development server at http://localhost:5175
npm run build      # Build for production (runs TypeScript check first)
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

### Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.io + TypeScript)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev        # Start development server with hot reload at http://localhost:5000
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript
npm start          # Run compiled JavaScript
npm run type-check # TypeScript validation only
```

### Full Application Setup
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (in another terminal)
3. Access app at http://localhost:5175
4. Other players join via `http://[HOST_IP]:5175`

## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
This is a **local network multiplayer web application** for assisting in-person American Mahjong games with an **intelligent co-pilot system**. It creates a digital overlay for physical gameplay with AI-powered pattern analysis and recommendations.

**Key Principle**: Players use phones as intelligent co-pilots while playing with physical tiles and boards. The architecture has been transformed from auto-pilot to co-pilot, giving players control while providing intelligent assistance.

### Core Components

#### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **React 18** with **TypeScript** and **Vite**
- **Zustand** for modern state management with devtools
- **Tailwind CSS** for mobile-first responsive design with modern design system
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Feature-based architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- Progressive Web App capabilities

#### Backend (`/backend`) 
- **Express** server with **Socket.io** for WebSocket communication
- **TypeScript** with **ts-node** for development
- **In-memory storage** (no database)
- **CORS configured** for local network access

#### Intelligence Layer (`/intelligence`)
- **NMJL 2025 Pattern Data** - Authentic National Mah Jongg League patterns
- **Analysis Engines** - Pattern matching and recommendation systems
- **Preserved Legacy Code** - Working analysis engines moved to `/legacy`

### Modern Co-Pilot Architecture

The application follows a **co-pilot pattern** where AI provides intelligent assistance while users maintain full control:

#### State Management (Zustand)
- **Game Store** - Room, player, and game phase management
- **UI Store** - User preferences, themes, and tutorial state  
- **Pattern Store** - Pattern selection, filtering, and progress tracking

#### Feature-Based Organization

### Development Chunks & Progress

Development follows a **context-window-sized chunk approach** documented in `docs/CO_PILOT_BUILD_PLAN.md`:

#### âœ… CHUNK 1: Foundation Setup & Basic UI
- Modern React 18 + TypeScript + Vite setup
- Zustand stores with devtools and persistence  
- UI component library with modern design system
- Responsive layout components and routing
- Hello Co-Pilot landing page

#### âœ… CHUNK 2: Pattern Selection Foundation
- NMJL 2025 service with authentic pattern data
- Pattern store with selection and filtering state
- Interactive pattern cards with difficulty/points/joker indicators
- Advanced search and filtering UI
- Pattern grid with responsive layout
- Selected patterns panel with strategy tips

#### ðŸ”„ Future Chunks (3-10)
- Tile input systems with animations
- Intelligence panel with Layer Cake UI
- Charleston coordination
- Live game interface
- Statistics and history
- Polish and optimization

### Important Development Patterns

#### Co-Pilot vs Auto-Pilot
- **Co-Pilot**: AI provides suggestions, user makes decisions
- **Pattern Selection**: User chooses target patterns explicitly
- **Recommendations**: AI suggests keep/pass/discard with reasoning
- **Control**: User maintains full agency over all game decisions

#### Modern State Management
- **Zustand** over Redux for simplicity and performance
- **Feature-based** stores instead of monolithic state
- **TypeScript-first** with proper type inference
- **Devtools integration** for debugging

#### Component Architecture  
- **Feature folders** group related components, stores, and logic
- **UI components** are pure, reusable building blocks
- **Mobile-first** responsive design with touch optimization
- **Accessibility** built into all interactive elements

#### Design System
- **Purple/Blue palette** (#6366F1 primary, #3B82F6 secondary) 
- **Glassmorphism effects** with backdrop blur and subtle borders
- **Modern animations** with respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom utility classes and component patterns

### Development Considerations

#### Privacy & Data Flow
- **Client-side pattern analysis** - All AI processing stays local
- **Private tile data** never sent to other players
- **Shared game state** for coordination (discards, phases, etc.)
- **User preference persistence** with localStorage

#### Performance & Scalability
- **Lazy loading** of pattern data and components
- **Efficient re-renders** with proper Zustand selectors
- **Mobile optimization** for touch devices and smaller screens
- **Progressive enhancement** with graceful degradation

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Comprehensive error boundaries** for component failures
- **Loading states** for all async operations
- **Network resilience** with retry mechanisms
- **User feedback** for all error conditions

### NMJL 2025 Pattern Integration

#### Data Source
- **Authentic NMJL Data**: `nmjl-card-2025.json` contains all 71 official patterns
- **Complete Pattern Details**: ID, description, points, difficulty, groups, joker rules
- **Validation & Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces with runtime validation

#### Pattern Selection System
- **Interactive Cards**: Touch-friendly pattern cards with visual indicators
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by difficulty, points, jokers, sections
- **Multiple Targets**: Users can star patterns they're considering
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual completion percentage for selected patterns

#### Intelligence Features (Future)
- **Pattern Matching**: Analyze current hand against all possible patterns
- **Completion Probability**: Calculate likelihood of completing each pattern
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Suggest keep/pass based on pattern requirements
- **Charleston Integration**: Pass recommendations considering target patterns

### Configuration Files
- `frontend/postcss.config.js` - Tailwind CSS with PostCSS setup
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Design system configuration
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Vite development and build settings
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript strict mode configuration
- `backend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler options for Node.js

### Testing Strategy
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for UI components
- **Store Testing**: Direct Zustand store testing without mocking
- **Integration Testing**: Feature-level testing with user flows
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-device testing on actual mobile devices

## Important Instructions

### File Organization
- **NEVER** move files from `legacy/` - they contain working systems
- **ALWAYS** create new files in the modern architecture folders
- **PREFER** editing existing files over creating new ones
- **NEVER** create markdown documentation files unless explicitly requested

### Development Approach
- **Follow the chunk plan** in `docs/CO_PILOT_BUILD_PLAN.md`
- **Complete chunks fully** before moving to the next
- **Test thoroughly** on mobile devices and different screen sizes
- **Maintain TypeScript strict mode** compliance
- **Use TodoWrite tool** proactively for progress tracking

### Code Style & Quality
- **No comments** unless explicitly requested
- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript** patterns (async/await, destructuring, etc.)
- **Functional components** with hooks over class components
- **Consistent naming** following existing patterns
- **Mobile-first** responsive design principles

This co-pilot architecture provides a solid foundation for building an intelligent American Mahjong assistant that enhances rather than replaces the social in-person gaming experience.
