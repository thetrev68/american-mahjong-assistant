Absolutely! You're right - we need to break this down into manageable chunks. Here's how I'd suggest we tackle hand analysis in separate sessions:

## Chunk 1: Basic Tile Input Interface
**Goal**: Players can privately input their actual tiles (not just count)
- Enhance the existing TileGrid component for private tile entry
- Add validation for proper tile counts
- Store tiles in component state
- Test tile input works correctly

## Chunk 2: Pattern Matching Foundation
**Goal**: Recognize basic American Mahjong patterns
- Create pattern definitions for common 2025 NMJL patterns
- Build pattern matching algorithm
- Test pattern recognition with sample hands

## Chunk 3: Recommendation Engine
**Goal**: Generate strategic advice based on hand analysis
- Implement keep/discard/charleston recommendations
- Add probability calculations
- Connect to the HandAnalysisPanel component

## Chunk 4: Integration & Polish
**Goal**: Connect everything together smoothly
- Integrate with game flow
- Add real-time updates via Socket.io
- Polish UI/UX and handle edge cases

## For Each New Chat Session
You can start with something like:
> "Continuing American Mahjong project - working on Chunk X of hand analysis. Here's the current state..." 

Then paste relevant files for that specific chunk.

Which chunk would you like to tackle first? I'd recommend starting with **Chunk 1 (Tile Input Interface)** since it's the most foundational and testable.
