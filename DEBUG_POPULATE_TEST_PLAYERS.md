# Debug: populate-test-players Not Reaching Backend

## Issue 
Frontend emits `populate-test-players` event but backend `socket.onAny()` doesn't catch it.

## Evidence

### Frontend Console Shows:
```
üé≤ Emitting populate-test-players via wrapper
üîå emit() called, event: populate-test-players socketRef.current: 6N1SHteAJDisB16PAAAD
üîå ‚úÖ emit WITHOUT callback completed for event: populate-test-players
```

### Backend Console Shows:
```
‚úÖ populate-test-players IS in listener list after registration
üéØ CAUGHT EVENT on socket 6N1SHteAJDisB16PAAAD: create-room  ‚Üê Works!
[NO EVENT CAUGHT for populate-test-players]  ‚Üê Missing!
```

### Socket IDs Match
- Frontend: `6N1SHteAJDisB16PAAAD`
- Backend: `6N1SHteAJDisB16PAAAD`
- ‚úÖ Same socket!

## Hypotheses

### 1. Event Lost in Transit (Socket.IO issue)
- Event emitted but not delivered
- Possible Socket.IO buffer issue
- Test: Add delay between create-room and populate-test-players

### 2. Event Name Mismatch
- Frontend emits: `populate-test-players`
- Backend listens: `populate-test-players`
- ‚úÖ Names match, this is NOT the issue

### 3. Socket Reconnection
- Socket disconnects/reconnects between events
- Event sent on wrong socket
- Would see different socket IDs (we don't)

### 4. Error in Socket Wrapper
- `useSocket.ts` emit() has a bug
- Event never actually sent
- But other events (create-room, ping) work fine

## Tests to Run

### Test 1: Add Delay
**Location:** `RoomSetupView.tsx:handleAutoPosition()`

```typescript
const handleAutoPosition = async () => {
  // ... existing code ...

  console.log('üé≤ Populating players via backend')
  console.log('‚è±Ô∏è Waiting 1 second before emitting...')
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))

  socket.emit('populate-test-players', { roomId })
}
```

### Test 2: Use Callback Instead
**Location:** `RoomSetupView.tsx:handleAutoPosition()`

```typescript
socket.emit('populate-test-players', { roomId }, (response) => {
  console.log('üì® Got callback response:', response)
})
```

### Test 3: Listen for ACK
Check if Socket.IO is configured to require acknowledgments.

### Test 4: Direct Socket Access
Bypass the wrapper:

```typescript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client'
const directSocket = io('http://localhost:5000')
directSocket.emit('populate-test-players', { roomId: '...' })
```

## Recommended Fix

Since `create-room` works fine but `populate-test-players` doesn't, and both use the same socket, the issue is likely:

**The populate event is being emitted too quickly after create-room.**

Socket.IO might still be processing the create-room response when populate is emitted, causing the event to be dropped.

### Quick Fix:
Add a small delay OR emit populate-test-players from WITHIN the room-created response handler:

```typescript
// In useMultiplayer.ts handleResponse
const handleResponse = (...args: unknown[]) => {
  const response = args[0] as { success: boolean; room?: Room }

  if (response.success && response.room) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // If in dev mode and auto-position was requested, emit now
    if (import.meta.env.DEV && shouldAutoPopulate) {
      socket.emit('populate-test-players', { roomId: response.room.id })
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Status
- ‚ùå Backend not receiving populate-test-players
- ‚úÖ All other socket events work fine
- ‚úÖ Socket IDs match
- ‚úÖ Event names match
- ‚úÖ Handler is registered

**Next Step:** Add 1-second delay before emitting populate-test-players to test if it's a timing issue.

## Progress Update (2025-10-09)

### What We Verified
- `create-room` flows end-to-end: frontend receives `room-created`, backend logs the event and emits back.
- Room IDs are 8-character uppercase values (server-generated); the 4-char code is UI-only and not used in server calls.
- The frontend emits `populate-test-players` on the same socket id used for `create-room`.
- When emitted from the app, the backend does NOT log receiving `populate-test-players`, and no ACK is observed on the client.
- A separate smoke client succeeds end-to-end (backend receives `populate-test-players`, adds players, emits `dev:players-populated`).

### Changes Implemented
- Frontend
  - Listen-before-emit for `room-created` and `room-joined` to prevent races: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useMultiplayer.ts`.
  - Dev auto-emit of `populate-test-players` immediately after `room-created` for sequencing: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useMultiplayer.ts`.
  - Added ACK callback logging for both auto and manual emits to confirm server receipt: `useMultiplayer.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/features/room-setup/RoomSetupView.tsx`.
  - Added dev-only client `onAny` logger to trace all incoming events: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.ts`.
  - Disabled/destroyed legacy room-multiplayer service to avoid conflicting listeners and stubbed actions: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useMultiplayer.ts`.
- Backend
  - Added unconditional handler for `populate-test-players` (not gated by NODE_ENV) with verbose logs and ACK support: `packages/backend/src/features/socket-communication/socket-handlers.ts`.
  - Added connection/registration logs to correlate socket ids and event listeners: `packages/backend/src/server.ts`.
- Tooling
  - Added a Socket.IO smoke test script to reproduce the exact flow out-of-app: `scripts/dev/socket-populate-smoke.mjs`.

### Results So Far
- Smoke script: PASS. Backend receives `populate-test-players`, adds players, and emits `dev:players-populated`.
- In-app: `populate-test-players` emits (auto + manual) show as sent, but:
  - No backend log for the event.
  - No ACK callback observed in frontend.
  - No `dev:players-populated` received by the frontend.
- Conclusion: The event is not reaching the server from the app, despite using the same connected socket immediately after a successful `create-room`.

### Outgoing Trace Findings
- Added dev-only outgoing tracer (monkey-patch of `socket.emit`) logs:
  - `client OUT: create-room ...` then `client onAny: room-created ...` (OK)
  - `client OUT: populate-test-players { roomId: <8-char> }` (both auto and manual)
  - No `client ACK for populate-test-players ...` seen
- Backend shows no `populate-test-players` receipt for those attempts.
- This confirms a transport drop of that specific event from the app context (not backend logic, not ID mapping), while other events (create-room) on the same socket work.

### Hypotheses (Updated)
- Client transport is dropping this specific event name from the app context (name-specific filtering or collision). Less likely but possible given smoke test passes.
- A listener or wrapper in-app is interfering with outbound emits for this event between provider boundaries (less likely given `create-room` works via same path).
- Not a room ID mapping issue (8-char id is used and valid, and server handler checks by `roomId`).

### Next Diagnostics
- After restart, capture whether ACK logs appear for both emits:
  - Auto (after `room-created`) and manual (from Auto Position).
  - If no ACK: confirm server never receives the event; proceed to emit an alternate diagnostic event name in parallel (dev-only) to isolate name-specific filtering.
  - If ACK success arrives but UI doesn‚Äôt update: verify `RoomSetupView.tsx` `socket.on('dev:players-populated', ...)` fires once and store updates propagate (Zustand store adapters after refactor).
- Keep verifying socket ids match between frontend and backend connection logs.

Additional high-signal checks (next session):
- Inspect WS frames in DevTools for `populate-test-players` right when Auto Position emits; if absent, emit didn‚Äôt leave the browser.
- Emit a trivial `test-event` immediately before populate in Auto Position to see if any event reaches backend at that moment.
- Optionally emit a parallel diagnostic event name (e.g., `dev:populate-players-alt`) to rule out name-specific filtering.

### Commands
- Run smoke test directly:
  - `BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 node scripts/dev/socket-populate-smoke.mjs`

### Notes
- In Multiplayer mode, `create-room` adds only Trevor initially. The other three players (Kim, Jordan, Emilie) are added by `populate-test-players`. Seeing only Trevor in `create-room` logs is expected.

## Progress Update (2025-10-10) - Critical Discovery

### The Smoking Gun
**WebSocket frames inspection reveals NO frames are sent for `populate-test-players`!**

Using Chrome DevTools Network tab ‚Üí WS filter ‚Üí Messages:
- ‚úÖ `create-room` frame appears and is transmitted
- ‚ùå `populate-test-players` frame NEVER appears in Messages tab
- ‚ùå `test-before-populate` diagnostic event also doesn't appear

**This means:** Frontend code calls `socket.emit()`, logs show "emit completed", but Socket.IO client **never sends the WebSocket frame**.

### What We Tried Today

#### 1. WebSocket Frame Inspection ‚úÖ
- **Result:** Confirmed emits after `create-room` produce NO WebSocket frames
- **Impact:** Isolated issue to Socket.IO client-side, not backend or network

#### 2. Socket State Diagnostics
- Checked `socket.connected`: `true` ‚úÖ
- Checked `engine.readyState`: `open` ‚úÖ
- Checked `engine.transport`: `websocket` ‚úÖ
- **Result:** Socket appears healthy but emits still fail

#### 3. Disabled Auto-Emit in useMultiplayer.ts
- Temporarily commented out auto-emit of `populate-test-players` after `room-created`
- **Result:** Manual emit from Auto Position button also fails (same issue)

#### 4. Tested rawSocket.emit() Direct Access ‚ùå
- Bypassed wrapper, called `socket.rawSocket.emit()` directly
- **Result:** Backend crashed/disconnected, not a viable path

#### 5. Disabled Monkey-Patch Logging
- Disabled `patchOutgoingLogging()` to test if monkey-patch was breaking emit
- **Result:** Same behavior - emits still don't generate WebSocket frames

#### 6. Attempted Socket.IO Debug Logging ‚ùå
- Added `localStorage.debug = 'socket.io-client:*'` in index.html
- Added `DEBUG=socket.io:*` to backend npm script
- Backend debug works perfectly (shows all packets received)
- **Frontend debug NEVER appears** despite `localStorage.debug` being set correctly
- **Conclusion:** Socket.IO client debug library may be stripped by Vite

#### 7. Backend Socket.IO Debug Analysis ‚úÖ
Backend logs show:
```
socket.io:socket got packet {"type":2,"data":["create-room",...]} ‚Üê Works!
socket.io:socket got packet {"type":2,"data":["ping",...]} ‚Üê Works!
[NO packet for populate-test-players] ‚Üê Never arrives!
```

Backend onAny catches `create-room` and `ping` but never sees `populate-test-players`.

#### 8. Connection Analysis
- Backend shows 2 connections on page load (normal for polling‚Üíwebsocket upgrade):
  1. First socket connects, then closes with "transport close" after 6 seconds
  2. Second socket remains connected and handles all events
- Frontend consistently uses the second (active) socket ID
- Not a stale socket reference issue

### Current Understanding

**The Pattern:**
- `create-room` emit ‚Üí ‚úÖ WebSocket frame sent ‚Üí ‚úÖ Backend receives
- `populate-test-players` emit ‚Üí ‚ùå NO WebSocket frame ‚Üí ‚ùå Backend never receives
- `ping` emit (30s interval) ‚Üí ‚úÖ WebSocket frame sent ‚Üí ‚úÖ Backend receives

**Key Facts:**
1. Socket state shows healthy (connected, open, websocket transport)
2. Frontend emit wrapper completes without errors
3. NO WebSocket frames generated for populate-test-players (confirmed via Network tab)
4. Backend Socket.IO debug shows packet never arrives
5. Smoke test script (standalone) works perfectly
6. Issue occurs for ALL emits after `create-room` completes (not just populate-test-players)

### Hypotheses (Narrowed)

#### Leading Theory: Socket.IO Client Internal State Corruption
After `create-room` completes, something puts Socket.IO client in a state where:
- Client thinks socket is connected (connected = true)
- Client accepts emit() calls and returns successfully
- **But internal packet queue/encoder is broken and doesn't transmit**

Possible causes:
- `socket.off('room-created', handleResponse)` cleanup interfering with socket internals
- Callback wrapping in monkey-patch corrupting emit after first use
- Socket.IO client bug with v4.8.1 in Vite dev environment
- Race condition between emit and some internal Socket.IO state change

#### Alternative Theory: Vite/Browser Issue
- Vite dev server or browser security policy blocking emits after initial connection
- Would explain why Socket.IO debug doesn't appear (stripped by Vite)
- Would explain why standalone smoke script works but in-app doesn't

### Tests to Try Next Session

#### Test 1: Remove socket.off() Cleanup
In `useMultiplayer.ts` line 154, the `socket.off('room-created', handleResponse)` happens immediately after response. Try moving it into the ACK callback or removing entirely.

#### Test 2: Completely Remove Monkey-Patch Code
Delete `patchOutgoingLogging` function entirely (not just disable the call) to ensure no code artifacts interfere.

#### Test 3: Test Different Event After create-room
After `create-room` succeeds, try emitting a simple test event like `ping` to see if ANY emit works.

#### Test 4: Add Delay Before Emit
```typescript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
socket.emit('populate-test-players', { roomId })
```

#### Test 5: Check for Multiple Socket Instances
Add logging to confirm only ONE socket instance exists in `globalSocketInstance`.

#### Test 6: Try Production Build
Run `npm run build` and test with production bundle to see if it's Vite dev-specific.
