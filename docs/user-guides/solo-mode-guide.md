## üéÆ Complete Solo Game Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Game Setup (2-3 minutes)

#### **1.1 Launch Solo Mode Before Game Starts**
```
Main Screen ‚Üí Solo Game ‚Üí Continue
```
**Do this while others are setting up tiles and getting comfortable**

#### **1.2 Pattern Selection Strategy**
Choose your patterns while others are still organizing:
- **Quick Selection**: 3-4 patterns to start focused
- **Mixed Difficulty**: Balance easy targets with stretch goals
- **Stay Flexible**: You can adjust during Charleston if needed

#### **1.3 Co-Pilot Calibration**
Your co-pilot prepares to track:
- **Your hand tiles** - Input as you receive them
- **Opponent actions** - Discards, calls, and exposed tiles you can see
- **Game state** - Charleston progress, wall tiles remaining
- **Strategic opportunities** - Real-time analysis during play

### Phase 2: Initial Hand Input (1-2 minutes)

#### **2.1 Input Your Starting 13 Tiles**
**As you receive tiles from the wall:**
- **Add each tile** to your hand in the app immediately
- **Keep phone discreet** - Don't let opponents see your screen
- **Double-check accuracy** - Wrong input leads to bad advice
- **Organize as you go** - Group similar tiles for easy reference

#### **2.2 Real-Time Hand Analysis**
Once your hand is complete, your co-pilot shows:
- **Pattern Progress** - Completion percentages for selected patterns
- **Charleston Strategy** - Which tiles to pass/keep
- **Missing Tiles** - Exactly what you need for each pattern
- **Strategic Priority** - Which patterns to focus on first

### Phase 3: Charleston Phase (5-8 minutes)

During the real Charleston with your opponents, use your co-pilot for strategic guidance.

#### **3.1 Real Charleston with AI Guidance**
**Your Process:**
1. **Check co-pilot recommendations** - See which tiles to pass/keep
2. **Select 3 physical tiles** to pass to the appropriate opponent  
3. **Update app with tiles passed** - Remove them from your hand
4. **Receive 3 tiles** from incoming opponent
5. **Input new tiles** into app immediately
6. **Review updated analysis** - See how your hand improved

#### **3.2 Co-Pilot Charleston Strategy**

**Pass Recommendations** üîÑ
Your co-pilot suggests which physical tiles to pass:
- **Low strategic value** - Tiles that don't advance your patterns
- **Safe duplicates** - You have multiple copies
- **Opponent awareness** - Avoid tiles they might need
- **Charleston timing** - Best tiles to pass in each round

**Keep Recommendations** üéØ
Your co-pilot highlights tiles to keep:
- **Pattern advancement** - Essential for your selected patterns
- **Multi-pattern value** - Tiles useful across multiple targets
- **Joker synergy** - Tiles that work well with jokers
- **Strategic flexibility** - Keep options open

#### **3.3 Charleston Round Management**

**First Charleston - Right, Across, Left**
- **Input each received tile** immediately after each pass
- **Check updated recommendations** between passes
- **Stay flexible** - Your strategy may evolve

**Second Charleston - Left, Across, Right** 
- **Track your hand changes** through each round
- **Watch opponent patterns** - Note what they're collecting
- **Adjust strategy** based on tiles received

**Optional Third Charleston - Across Only**
- **Co-pilot advises** whether to participate
- **1-3 tile decision** - App calculates optimal number
- **Final hand optimization** before main game

#### **3.4 Charleston Decision Framework**

For each tile, ask:
1. **Does this tile help any of my patterns?** 
   - If yes ‚Üí likely keep
   - If no ‚Üí consider passing

2. **Do I have multiple copies?**
   - If yes ‚Üí safe to pass one
   - If no ‚Üí keep unless completely useless

3. **Could this help opponents?**
   - Avoid passing obvious jokers or needed tiles
   - Consider what patterns opponents might be building

4. **What does my co-pilot recommend?**
   - Trust the AI analysis for complex decisions
   - Read the reasoning to learn strategy

### Phase 4: Main Gameplay Phase (15-25 minutes)

Real gameplay with your three opponents, using AI co-pilot for strategic advantage.

#### **4.1 Your Turn Management**
**When it's your turn:**
1. **Draw your tile** from the wall or take a discard
2. **Input the new tile** into the app immediately
3. **Check co-pilot analysis** - Updated hand evaluation
4. **Make your decision** - Call, kong, or discard
5. **Update the app** - Remove discarded tile from your hand
6. **Input your discard** into the shared discard tracking

#### **4.2 Tracking Opponent Actions**
**When opponents take their turns:**
- **Input their discards** into the app's discard pile
- **Track their calls** - Note any pung/kong/quint they expose
- **Update exposed tiles** - Keep the app informed of all visible tiles
- **Watch for patterns** - Your co-pilot analyzes opponent strategies

#### **4.3 Co-Pilot Real-Time Analysis**

**Your Turn Guidance** üéØ
When you draw a tile:
- **Instant tile value** - How much this tile helps your patterns
- **Updated completion %** - New progress on all selected patterns  
- **Call opportunities** - Should you pung/kong from previous discards?
- **Best discard recommendation** - Which tile to discard and why

**Call Decision Support** üì¢
When opponents discard tiles you could use:
- **5-second alert** - Quick notification of call opportunity
- **Strategic analysis** - Should you call or let it go?
- **Pattern impact** - How the call affects your overall strategy
- **Timing recommendation** - Whether now is the right time

**Discard Strategy** üóëÔ∏è
For every discard decision:
- **Safety analysis** - Which tiles won't help opponents
- **Strategic value ranking** - Best tiles to keep vs. discard
- **Opponent awareness** - Avoid feeding tiles they're collecting
- **Multi-pattern optimization** - Keep tiles that serve multiple patterns

#### **4.4 Critical Decision Points in Real Games**

**When to Call vs. Continue** (With Real Opponents)
‚úÖ **Call when your co-pilot recommends:**
- **Significant pattern advancement** - The tile completes a major group
- **Close to mahjong** - You're 1-2 tiles away from winning
- **Strategic timing** - Opponents aren't close to winning
- **Multiple pattern benefit** - The call helps several patterns

‚ùå **Don't call when warned:**
- **Marginal improvement** - Only minor help to your hand
- **Too early** - Still far from completion
- **Pattern destruction** - Ruins better opportunities
- **Opponent advantage** - They're too close to winning

**Real-Time Pattern Switching**
Your co-pilot suggests switches when:
- **Current patterns stalling** - Low progress despite many turns
- **New opportunities** - Drawn tiles open better patterns
- **Opponent interference** - They're blocking your current strategy
- **15% improvement rule** - New pattern significantly better

**Managing Jokers Against Real Opponents**
- **Hide joker usage** - Don't expose until necessary
- **Save for rare tiles** - Use for tiles unlikely to be discarded
- **Endgame timing** - Deploy jokers for pattern completion
- **Opponent awareness** - Consider what they might need

#### **4.5 Endgame with Human Opponents**

**Reading the Table**
- **Watch opponent discards** - App helps identify their patterns
- **Track exposed tiles** - See what's no longer available
- **Count wall tiles** - Know how many draws remain
- **Assess winning chances** - Co-pilot calculates probabilities

**Final Push Strategy**
- **Defensive discarding** - Don't feed opponents winning tiles
- **Winning tile recognition** - Know all tiles that complete your patterns
- **Call readiness** - Be prepared to call mahjong instantly
- **Backup patterns** - Keep alternatives if main pattern fails

### Phase 5: Game Completion

#### **5.1 Winning Against Real Opponents**
When you complete a pattern with co-pilot help:
1. **Declare "Mahjong"** - Announce your win to the table
2. **Show your hand** - Prove it matches your claimed NMJL pattern
3. **Verify with card** - Opponents check against the official card
4. **Calculate points** - Score based on pattern value and concealment
5. **Celebrate discretely** - Your AI co-pilot helped, but you made the decisions

#### **5.2 Learning from Real Games**
After playing with your co-pilot against humans:
- **Co-pilot accuracy** - How often did you follow AI recommendations?
- **Decision outcomes** - Which AI suggestions worked vs. didn't work?
- **Opponent patterns** - What did you learn about their strategies?
- **Timing insights** - When to trust AI vs. human intuition
- **Social dynamics** - How to use AI help without being obvious
