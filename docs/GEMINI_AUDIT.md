# Gemini Code Audit: American Mahjong Assistant

**Auditor:** Gemini

## 1. Overall Summary

This is a well-architected and robust project that follows modern best practices for web development. The codebase is clean, organized, and demonstrates a strong understanding of both frontend and backend development principles. The use of TypeScript across the stack, coupled with a shared types package, provides a solid foundation for type safety and maintainability. The separation of concerns is excellent, both in the overall project structure and within individual modules.

The project is in a very good state. The recommendations below are minor and aimed at further refinement rather than fixing any significant issues.

## 2. Project Structure & Configuration

The project is structured as a monorepo-like repository with clear separation between the `frontend`, `backend`, and a `shared` directory for common types. This is an ideal setup for this kind of application.

- **Configuration:** Both `frontend` and `backend` packages have clean, modern configuration files.
- **TypeScript:** `tsconfig.json` is set up with `strict: true` mode, which is a best practice for catching potential errors. Path aliases (`@/shared`, `@/frontend`, etc.) are used effectively to simplify imports.
- **Code Quality:** The frontend uses ESLint with a modern flat configuration, extending recommended rule sets to enforce code quality.
- **Dependencies:** The dependencies chosen (React, Vite, Zustand, Express, Socket.IO) are appropriate and popular choices for this stack.

## 3. Frontend Analysis

The frontend is built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, which is a powerful and efficient combination.

- **Architecture:** The application is structured around feature-based components and pages, which is highly scalable. The use of a global `AppLayout` and a `RouterProvider` to handle the main structure is clean and effective.
- **State Management:** The use of **Zustand** for client-side state (`game-store.ts`) is excellent. The store is well-defined, type-safe, and uses immutable updates correctly. The inclusion of `devtools` middleware is a great touch for debugging.
- **Routing:** `react-router-dom` is used correctly. The implementation of a `RouteGuard` component to protect routes based on game state is a standout feature, demonstrating robust application flow control.
- **Styling:** The use of Tailwind CSS is noted in the `package.json` and is a modern choice for utility-first styling.

## 4. Backend Analysis

The backend is a Node.js application using Express and Socket.IO, written in TypeScript.

- **Architecture:** The logic is cleanly separated into feature-based modules (`room-lifecycle`, `socket-communication`, `state-sync`). The `RoomManager` class is a prime example of good object-oriented design, encapsulating all logic related to room management.
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO is set up correctly with proper CORS configuration for handling client connections.
- **Robustness:** The `RoomManager` includes excellent logic for handling edge cases, such as host migration when a player leaves, and a crucial `cleanupInactiveRooms` method to prevent memory leaks from stale game rooms.
- **Error Handling:** The backend code throws descriptive errors, which is helpful for debugging and for communicating issues to the client.
- **Scalability Note:** The backend currently uses in-memory storage. This is perfectly fine for development and many use cases, but for future scalability and persistence across server restarts, migrating state to a dedicated store like **Redis** would be the logical next step.

---

## 5. Shared Code (`/shared`)

The `shared` directory is a key strength of this project.

- **Single Source of Truth:** It provides a single, authoritative source for data structures (`Room`, `Player`) and, most importantly, `SocketEvents`.
- **Type Safety:** The `SocketEvents` interface provides end-to-end type safety for real-time communication, which is a high-impact pattern that prevents an entire class of common bugs.

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

The codebase is already in great shape. These are minor suggestions for further improvement.

1.  **Strengthen Shared Types:**
    - In `shared/multiplayer-types.ts`, the `discardPile` is typed as `any[]`. This could be strengthened by defining a `Tile` type and using `Tile[]`.
    - **Example:**
      ```typescript
      export interface Tile {
        suit: 'bamboo' | 'character' | 'dot' | 'wind' | 'dragon' | 'flower';
        value: string; // e.g., '1', 'north', 'red'
      }

      export interface SharedGameState {
        discardPile: Tile[]; // Formerly any[]
        // ...
      }
      ```

2.  **Harmonize State Definitions:**
    - The `Player` type in `frontend/src/stores/game-store.ts` has diverged slightly from the one in `shared/multiplayer-types.ts`.
    - **Recommendation:** Consider creating a `ClientPlayer` type in the frontend that extends the shared `Player` type. This makes the relationship explicit and improves clarity.
    - **Example (`game-store.ts`):**
      ```typescript
      import type { Player as SharedPlayer } from '@shared/multiplayer-types';

      export interface ClientPlayer extends SharedPlayer {
        position: 'east' | 'south' | 'west' | 'north' | null;
        isReady: boolean;
        isConnected: boolean;
      }

      export interface GameState {
        players: ClientPlayer[];
        // ...
      }
      ```

3.  **Consolidate Duplicate Routes:**
    - In `frontend/src/utils/router.tsx`, the routes `/patterns` and `/pattern-selection` point to the same component. If `/patterns` is not needed, it could be removed to simplify the configuration. If it's an intentional alias, this is fine.

4.  **Add a Backend Linter:**
    - The frontend has a comprehensive ESLint setup, but the backend does not appear to have a linter configured in its `package.json` scripts.
    - **Recommendation:** Add ESLint to the backend to enforce consistent coding style and catch potential issues, mirroring the setup on the frontend.
