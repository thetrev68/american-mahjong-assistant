● Based on my analysis of the current implementation versus your described real-world 4-player game flow, here's what I found:

  ❌ MAJOR GAPS - Current Architecture vs Real-World Flow

  1. Room Setup Mismatch

  Your Real-World Flow:
  - Multi-player: Room codes, players join, seating assigned
  - Solo: Enter other player names, assign seats

  Current Implementation:
  - ✅ Multi-player mode: Has room creation/joining with codes
  - ❌ Solo mode limitation: Supports "otherPlayerNames" but doesn't fully implement the solo workflow where one person manages all players

  2. Tile Input Phase Gap

  Your Real-World Flow:
  - Multi-player: Each player enters own tiles
  - Solo: Player 1 enters only their hand, marks others ready

  Current Implementation:
  - ✅ Has tile input interface
  - ❌ Missing multi-player coordination: No synchronization for "when all players are ready"
  - ❌ Missing solo workflow: No way for solo player to mark others ready without entering their tiles

  3. Charleston Phase Major Issues

  Your Real-World Flow:
  - Full 3-round cycle: right → across → left → optional loop (max 3 times)
  - Multi-player: Each player passes 3 tiles, synchronization when all ready
  - Solo: Player 1 passes tiles AND receives tiles in separate steps

  Current Implementation:
  - ✅ Phase tracking: Has right/across/left phases in charleston-store.ts
  - ❌ No multi-player coordination: Missing synchronization mechanics
  - ❌ No solo workflow: No separate "send" and "receive" steps
  - ❌ No optional loop logic: Missing turn counter and bypass options

  4. Game Phase Critical Gap

  Your Real-World Flow:
  - Turn-based with East→North→West→South rotation
  - Actions: draw, discard, call, swap joker, swap blank, mahjong, pass out
  - Multi-player: Players enter own moves
  - Solo: Player 1 observes and enters all visible moves

  Current Implementation:
  - ✅ Co-pilot interface: Great AI recommendations and analysis
  - ❌ No turn management system: Missing player rotation logic
  - ❌ No multi-player synchronization: No real-time move coordination
  - ❌ Limited actions: Has draw/discard/call but missing joker swaps, blanks, mahjong, pass out
  - ❌ No solo observation mode: Missing workflow for solo player tracking others' moves

  🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Mark User Journey as Outdated

  Mark xuser_journey_mapping.md with an X - it describes an ideal vision that doesn't match your current co-pilot architecture.

  Current Reality: Your implementation is a single-player intelligent co-pilot that provides excellent AI assistance but lacks the multiplayer coordination and turn management described in your real-world flow.

  Gap Summary:
  - ❌ Real multiplayer synchronization missing
  - ❌ Solo mode workflow incomplete
  - ❌ Turn-based game mechanics missing
  - ❌ Charleston coordination missing
  - ✅ Excellent AI co-pilot intelligence (your strength)

  The user journey document describes a much more complex multiplayer game coordinator, while your current implementation is actually a sophisticated single-player AI assistant.
