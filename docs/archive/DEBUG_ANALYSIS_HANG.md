# Analysis Hang Debug Report

## Issue
The app gets stuck on "Loading AI Analysis" when navigating from Tile Input to Game Play. The analysis never completes.

## Root Cause Investigation

### Changes Made for Debugging

1. **Added extensive logging to `pattern-variation-loader.ts`**:
   - Logs when pattern data loading starts
   - Logs fetch progress
   - Logs parse completion
   - Added 10-second timeout to prevent infinite hangs
   - Logs detailed error messages

2. **Added extensive logging to `analysis-engine.ts`**:
   - Logs at start of `analyzeHand()` showing inputs (tiles, patterns, context)
   - Logs before/after Engine 1 (Pattern Analysis)
   - Logs before/after Engine 2 (Pattern Ranking)
   - Logs before/after Engine 3 (Tile Recommendations)
   - Logs final completion with timing metrics
   - Logs cache statistics

### What to Look For in Console

When you navigate from Tile Input to Game Play, you should see this sequence:

```
🚀 STARTING HAND ANALYSIS
   - Tiles: 13 - north, 5D, joker, 6B, 2D, 1C, 3C, 7B, 3C, west, 6B, 7C, 9B
   - Selected patterns: 0
   - Pattern switching: false

### Where the Hang Occurs

The last log message you see before it hangs will tell you where the problem is:

1. **No logs at all**: `analyzeHand` isn't being called
2. **Stops at "Getting patterns"**: `nmjlService.getSelectionOptions()` is hanging
3. **Stops at "PatternVariationLoader: Starting"**: Fetch never starts
4. **Stops at "PatternVariationLoader: Fetching"**: Fetch is hanging (timeout should catch this)
5. **Stops at "PatternVariationLoader: Parsing"**: JSON parsing is hanging
6. **Stops at "ENGINE 1 STARTING"**: Engine 1 call is hanging
7. **Stops during Engine 1/2/3**: That specific engine is hanging

## Expected Behavior

With proper error handling, you should either:
- See analysis complete successfully in 1-5 seconds
- See a clear error message with timeout after 10 seconds
- See the specific engine/step where it fails

## Test Steps

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev:frontend`
2. Navigate to Tile Input
3. Enter the hand: north, 5D, joker, 6B, 2D, 1C, 3C, 7B, 3C, west, 6B, 7C, 9B
4. Navigate to Game Play
5. Watch the console for the debug logs above
6. Report back which log is the LAST one you see before it hangs
