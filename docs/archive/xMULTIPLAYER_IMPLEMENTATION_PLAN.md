## 🏗️ **Implementation Strategy & Priorities**

### **Recommended Development Order**
1. **Phase 1** (Foundation) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**
   - Without real-time sync, nothing else works
   - Focus on backend infrastructure and WebSocket events
2. **Phase 2** (Room Setup) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Enables basic multiplayer testing
   - Foundation for all coordination features
3. **Phase 3** (Charleston) - **MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Complex but well-defined mechanics
   - Good test case for synchronization logic
4. **Phase 4** (Gameplay) - **HIGHEST COMPLEXITY**
   - Most time-consuming phase
   - Break into smaller chunks (turn management → actions → AI)
5. **Phase 5-6** (Polish) - **FINAL PHASE**
   - After core functionality is working

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Start with Solo Mode**: Easier to implement and test
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Keep single-player mode working while adding multiplayer
- **Modular Architecture**: Each phase should be independently testable
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always maintain working co-pilot functionality

### **Technical Considerations**
- **Performance**: Real-time sync with 4 players requires optimization
- **Network Reliability**: Handle poor connections gracefully  
- **State Management**: Complex coordination requires careful Zustand store design
- **Testing Strategy**: Automated testing for multiplayer coordination logic
