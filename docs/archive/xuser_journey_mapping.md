## üí≠ Key Experience Principles

### **Information Hierarchy - "Layer Cake" UI**
1. **Layer 1** (Always visible): Turn status, top 2 hands, safest discard
2. **Layer 2** (Tap tile): Discard impact, opponent risks
3. **Layer 3** (Menu): Full probability tables, simulation data

### **Timing**
- **Instant**: Basic pattern updates
- **2-3 seconds**: Discard safety analysis
- **On-demand**: Deep "what if" scenarios
- **Background**: Opponent modeling and threat assessment

### **Control Balance**
- **You decide**: All final choices are yours
- **App suggests**: Multiple options with analysis
- **Never automatic**: No moves made without your input
- **Always transparent**: Show why analysis suggests something

### **Social Experience**
- **Maintains physical game**: App enhances, doesn't replace table interaction
- **Shared moments**: Everyone sees discards and calls together
- **Personal advantage**: Your analysis is private until you act
- **Group learning**: Option to share insights after the game

## ‚ùì Questions for Refinement

1. **Analysis Depth**: How much detail feels helpful vs overwhelming?
2. **Timing**: When do you want to see analysis? (immediately vs on-demand)
3. **Opponent Intelligence**: How much should you know about others' potential hands?
4. **Learning Integration**: Should the app teach you patterns during play?
5. **Customization**: What aspects should be adjustable per player?
