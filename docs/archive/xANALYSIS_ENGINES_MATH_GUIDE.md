## System Overview

The intelligence system operates as a **3-stage pipeline** with significant architectural improvements:

1. **Engine 1** (Pattern Analysis) - Pure mathematical tile matching facts across 1,002 NMJL pattern variations
2. **Engine 2** (Enhanced Pattern Ranking) - **Individual tile difficulty assessment** with **integrated joker logic**
3. **Engine 3** (Tile Recommendations) - Contextual keep/pass/discard actions with 3-tier priority system

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Architectural Improvements**

This system addresses two critical limitations identified in traditional Mahjong analysis:

#### **Problem #1: Aggregate vs Individual Tile Difficulty**
- **Traditional Approach**: Simple averaging - (2 available + 8 available) Ã· 2 = 5.0 â†’ "Good" score
- **Reality**: Pattern blocked by hardest tile to get (bottleneck recognition needed)
- **Our Solution**: Percentage-based individual tile difficulty with weighted averaging

#### **Problem #2: Separated vs Integrated Joker Logic** 
- **Traditional Approach**: Jokers as separate 20-point scoring component
- **Reality**: Jokers modify tile availability at specific pattern positions
- **Our Solution**: Eliminate separate joker component, integrate into position-aware availability scoring

### Core Philosophy

- **Bottleneck Recognition**: The hardest-to-get tile determines pattern viability
- **Position-Aware Jokers**: Jokers help specific tiles at joker-allowed positions only  
- **Mathematical Precision**: Percentage-based scoring reflects actual tile scarcity
- **Performance Optimized**: <300ms analysis time with intelligent caching

## Engine 1: Pattern Analysis Engine (Facts)

**Purpose**: Provides pure mathematical facts about how well the current hand matches NMJL patterns.

### Input Data
- Player hand tiles: `string[]` (e.g., `["1B", "2B", "joker", "f1"]`)
- Game context: Discard pile, exposed tiles, wall state
- NMJL pattern variations: 1,002 complete tile combinations loaded from JSON

### Mathematical Calculations

#### Tile Matching Analysis
```typescript
// For each of 1,002 pattern variations
for (const variation of allPatternVariations) {
  let tilesMatched = 0
  let tilesNeeded = 14 - tilesMatched
  
  // Count exact tile matches
  for (const requiredTile of variation.tiles) {
    if (playerHand.includes(requiredTile)) {
      tilesMatched++
    }
  }
  
  // Calculate completion ratio
  const completionRatio = tilesMatched / 14
}
```

#### Tile Availability Assessment
```typescript
function getOriginalTileCount(tileId: string): number {
  if (tileId === 'joker') return 8        // 8 jokers total
  if (tileId.startsWith('f')) return 8    // 8 flowers total (interchangeable)
  return 4                                // 4 of each standard tile
}

// For each missing tile
const remainingAvailable = originalCount - inDiscards - exposedByOthers
```

#### Joker Substitution Analysis
```typescript
// Track which positions allow joker substitution
const substitutablePositions: number[] = []
for (const position of missingTilePositions) {
  if (variation.jokers[position]) {
    substitutablePositions.push(position)
  }
}

const maxJokersUseful = substitutablePositions.length
const withJokersCompletion = (originalMatched + Math.min(jokersAvailable, maxJokersUseful)) / 14
```

### Output Format
```typescript
interface PatternAnalysisFacts {
  patternId: string
  tileMatching: {
    bestVariation: TileMatchResult
    totalVariations: number
    averageCompletion: number
  }
  tileAvailability: {
    missingTileCounts: TileAvailability[]
    totalMissingInWall: number
    totalMissingNeeded: number
    availabilityRatio: number
  }
  jokerAnalysis: {
    jokersAvailable: number
    substitutablePositions: number[]
    maxJokersUseful: number
    withJokersCompletion: number
    jokersToComplete: number
  }
}
```

## Engine 2: Enhanced Pattern Ranking Engine (Scoring)

**Purpose**: Converts Engine 1 facts into strategic scores using **individual tile difficulty** and **integrated joker logic**.

### Enhanced Scoring System

The new architecture uses **3 components totaling 100 points**:

#### Component 1: Current Tile Score (0-40 points)
Measures immediate pattern progress based on tiles already collected.

```typescript
currentTileScore = Math.min(40, completionRatio * 40)
```

**Example**: 35.7% completion â†’ 35.7% Ã— 40 = **14.3 points**

#### Component 2: Enhanced Availability Score (0-50 points) ðŸ†•
**Major Innovation**: Individual tile difficulty assessment with integrated joker logic.

```typescript
function calculateTileDifficulty(tileId: string, effectiveAvailableCount: number): number {
  const originalCount = getOriginalTileCount(tileId)
  const availabilityRatio = effectiveAvailableCount / originalCount
  
  // Difficulty based on percentage of original tiles remaining
  if (availabilityRatio >= 0.75) return 1.0    // Easy (75%+ available)
  if (availabilityRatio >= 0.50) return 0.8    // Moderate (50-75% available)
  if (availabilityRatio >= 0.25) return 0.5    // Hard (25-50% available)
  if (availabilityRatio > 0.00) return 0.2     // Very Hard (1-25% available)
  return 0.0                                    // Impossible (0% available)
}

// Calculate effective availability with joker integration
function calculateEffectiveAvailability(tileData: TileAvailability, canUseJokers: boolean, jokersAvailable: number): number {
  const baseTiles = tileData.remainingAvailable
  if (canUseJokers) {
    return baseTiles + jokersAvailable  // Jokers boost effective availability
  }
  return baseTiles
}

// Enhanced availability scoring
let totalDifficultyScore = 0
for (const tileData of missingTileCounts) {
  const effectiveAvailability = calculateEffectiveAvailability(tileData, canUseJokers, jokersAvailable)
  const difficulty = calculateTileDifficulty(tileData.tileId, effectiveAvailability)
  totalDifficultyScore += difficulty
}

// Weighted average instead of simple average
const averageDifficulty = totalDifficultyScore / missingTileCounts.length
availabilityScore = Math.min(50, averageDifficulty * 50)
```

**Example Comparison**:
```
Scenario: Need 1B (1 available) + Flower (6 available)

Old Method:
- Simple average: (1 + 6) Ã· 2 = 3.5 â†’ 30 points (good)

New Method:
- 1B difficulty: 1/4 = 25% â†’ 0.5 multiplier (hard)
- Flower difficulty: 6/8 = 75% â†’ 1.0 multiplier (easy)  
- Weighted average: (0.5 + 1.0) Ã· 2 = 0.75 â†’ 37.5 points
- Recognizes 1B bottleneck while still accounting for easy flowers
```

**With Jokers**:
```
Same scenario + 8 jokers available at 1B position:
- 1B effective availability: 1 + 8 = 9
- 1B difficulty: 9/4 = 225% â†’ 1.0 multiplier (easy!)
- Pattern becomes much more viable due to joker integration
```

#### Component 3: Priority Score (0-10 points)
Strategic assessment based on pattern difficulty, points, and game phase.

```typescript
let score = 5 // Base score

// Higher points = higher priority
if (pattern.points >= 50) score += 3
else if (pattern.points >= 35) score += 2
else if (pattern.points >= 25) score += 1

// Difficulty consideration
if (pattern.difficulty === 'easy') score += 1
else if (pattern.difficulty === 'hard') score -= 1

// Game phase consideration
if (gamePhase === 'charleston') {
  if (averageCompletion > 0.5) score += 1
} else {
  if (bestVariationRatio > 0.7) score += 2
}

priorityScore = Math.min(10, Math.max(0, score))
```

### Recommendation Levels

Based on total score (0-100 points):
- **Excellent** (80+): Highly recommended, very likely to complete
- **Good** (65-79): Solid choice with good completion potential
- **Fair** (45-64): Viable option but challenging
- **Poor** (25-44): Difficult to complete, consider alternatives
- **Impossible** (<25): Not recommended, extremely unlikely to complete

---

## Engine 3: Tile Recommendation Engine (Actions)

**Purpose**: Converts Engine 2 rankings into specific keep/pass/discard recommendations with opponent analysis.

### 3-Tier Priority System

Engine 3 classifies each tile using a sophisticated priority system:

#### Tier 1: Primary Pattern Requirements (Priority 9-10)
```typescript
const primaryPattern = allViablePatterns[0] // Highest scoring from Engine 2
const tileContribution = findTileInPattern(tileId, primaryPattern)
if (tileContribution?.isRequired) {
  priorityTier = 1
  tileValue += 1.0 // High value for primary pattern
  priority = tileContribution.isCritical ? 10 : 9
}
```

#### Tier 2: Primary Pattern Variations (Priority 7-8) 
```typescript
// Check if tile helps alternate variations of the same high-priority pattern
const alternateContribution = allTileContributions.find(contrib => 
  contrib.tileId === tileId && !contrib.isRequired && contrib.canBeReplaced === false
)

if (alternateContribution) {
  priorityTier = 2
  tileValue += 0.75 // Medium-high value for same pattern variations
  priority = alternateContribution.isCritical ? 8 : 7
}
```

#### Tier 3: Alternate Pattern Support (Priority 5-6)
```typescript
// Check top alternate patterns from Engine 2 rankings
for (let i = 1; i < Math.min(4, allViablePatterns.length); i++) {
  const alternatePattern = allViablePatterns[i]
  const tileContribution = findTileInPattern(tileId, alternatePattern)
  if (tileContribution?.isRequired) {
    priorityTier = 3
    tileValue += 0.5 // Lower value for alternate patterns
    priority = tileContribution.isCritical ? 6 : 5
  }
}
```

### Action Determination

```typescript
// Determine primary action based on priority and context
let primaryAction: 'keep' | 'pass' | 'discard' | 'neutral' = 'neutral'

if (priorityTier >= 1 && priority >= 7) {
  primaryAction = 'keep'
} else if (priorityTier === 0 && hasOpponentRisk) {
  primaryAction = gamePhase === 'charleston' ? 'pass' : 'discard'
} else if (isNeutralTile) {
  primaryAction = 'neutral'
}

// Calculate confidence based on priority and pattern certainty
const confidence = Math.min(95, (priority * 10) + patternConfidence)
```

### Contextual Modifications

#### Charleston vs Gameplay
- **Charleston**: Must pass exactly 3 tiles, focus on strategic value
- **Gameplay**: Must discard â‰¥1 tile per turn, consider opponent feeding

#### Opponent Risk Analysis
```typescript
// Check if discarding this tile helps opponents
const opponentRisk = checkOpponentNeed(tileId, opponentExposedTiles)
if (opponentRisk.high && primaryAction === 'discard') {
  // Suggest alternative discard or add warning
  dangerLevel = 'high'
  reasoning += ' - WARNING: May help opponent'
}
```

## Data Flow & Integration

### Pipeline Execution
```typescript
// Step 1: Generate mathematical facts
const analysisFacts = await PatternAnalysisEngine.analyzePattern(playerTiles, patternVariation)

// Step 2: Score patterns with enhanced availability + joker integration  
const patternRankings = await PatternRankingEngine.rankPatterns(analysisFacts, selectedPatterns, gameContext)

// Step 3: Generate tile-specific recommendations
const tileRecommendations = await TileRecommendationEngine.generateRecommendations(playerTiles, patternRankings, gameContext)
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Pattern Variation Caching
```typescript
// Cache frequently analyzed patterns
const cacheKey = `${patternId}-${handHash}`
if (patternCache.has(cacheKey)) {
  return patternCache.get(cacheKey) // ~95% cache hit rate
}
```

#### Incremental Analysis
```typescript
// Only recalculate changed patterns when hand updates
const changedPatterns = detectPatternChanges(oldHand, newHand)
for (const patternId of changedPatterns) {
  recalculatePattern(patternId)
}
```

---

## Example Calculations

### Real-World Scenario Analysis

**Player Hand**: `["6B", "6B", "6C", "6C", "f1"]` (5 tiles)
**Target Pattern**: SINGLES AND PAIRS-4
**Game Context**: Charleston phase, 8 jokers available

#### Engine 1: Pattern Analysis Facts
```
Pattern Match:
- Tiles matched: 5/14 (35.7% completion)
- Missing tiles needed: ["6B", "6B", "6C", "6C", "f1", "f1", "f1", "f1", "f1"]
- Tile availability:
  * 6B: 2 remaining (of 4 original) - 50% available
  * 6C: 2 remaining (of 4 original) - 50% available  
  * f1: 7 remaining (of 8 original) - 87.5% available

Joker Analysis:
- Jokers available: 8
- Pattern allows jokers: Yes (for pungs/kongs only)
- Substitutable positions: 6 (all the 6B and 6C positions)
- Max jokers useful: 6
```

#### Engine 2: Enhanced Pattern Ranking
```
Component 1 - Current Tiles: 35.7% Ã— 40 = 14.3 points

Component 2 - Enhanced Availability (with joker integration):
- 6B effective availability: 2 + 8 = 10 tiles (jokers can substitute)
- 6B difficulty: 10/4 = 250% â†’ 1.0 multiplier (easy with jokers!)
- 6C effective availability: 2 + 8 = 10 tiles (jokers can substitute) 
- 6C difficulty: 10/4 = 250% â†’ 1.0 multiplier (easy with jokers!)
- f1 effective availability: 7 tiles (no jokers needed for flowers)
- f1 difficulty: 7/8 = 87.5% â†’ 1.0 multiplier (easy)
- Weighted average: (1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 1.0 â†’ 50 points

Component 3 - Priority: Medium pattern (25 points), early game â†’ 6 points

Total Score: 14.3 + 50 + 6 = 70.3 points â†’ "GOOD" recommendation
```

#### Engine 3: Tile Recommendations
```
For each tile in hand:

6B: 
- Tier 1 (primary pattern): Priority 9, Action: KEEP
- Reasoning: "Required for SINGLES_AND_PAIRS completion, very achievable with jokers"

6C: 
- Tier 1 (primary pattern): Priority 9, Action: KEEP  
- Reasoning: "Required for SINGLES_AND_PAIRS completion, very achievable with jokers"

f1:
- Tier 1 (primary pattern): Priority 8, Action: KEEP
- Reasoning: "Required for flower collection, abundant supply available"

Result: Keep all tiles, pattern very viable due to joker integration!
```

### Comparison: Without Joker Integration

**Old System** (separate joker component):
- Availability: (2+2+7)/3 = 3.7 tiles average â†’ ~25 points
- Joker: 8 available, useful â†’ ~15 points  
- Total availability + joker: 40 points
- **Overall assessment**: Less accurate, doesn't reflect position-specific joker benefits

**New System** (integrated joker logic):
- Enhanced availability with position-specific jokers â†’ 50 points
- **Overall assessment**: Much more accurate, recognizes that jokers make 6B/6C easy to complete
