# Code Audit Report - 2025-08-29

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit was conducted to identify dead code, mock data, fallback logic, and other signals of incomplete or poor work.

The codebase is generally clean of typical indicators like `TODO`, `FIXME`, and stray `console.log` statements. However, the audit identified three main categories of files that should be reviewed and likely removed:

1.  **Root-Level Debugging Files:** Several standalone scripts and an HTML file exist for debugging a specific engine issue.
2.  **Redundant Asset Backups:** A backup file for the tile sprite configuration was found.
3.  **Legacy Code Directory:** An entire `legacy` directory containing outdated code and documentation is present.

These files and directories clutter the repository and could confuse future development efforts.

## 2. Findings

### 2.1. Root-Level Debugging Files

A number of files appear to have been created for one-off debugging tasks and are no longer integrated into the application.

**Files:**
- `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\debug-engine3.js`
- `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\debug-integration-test.js`
- `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\test-debug.js`
- `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\frontend\debug-test.html`

**Analysis:**
These scripts contain hardcoded data and logic simulations specifically targeting an "Engine 3" issue related to the "SINGLES AND PAIRS #2" hand. They are not part of the main application source and appear to be temporary artifacts from a previous debugging session.

**Recommendation:**
Delete these four files.

### 2.2. Redundant Asset Backups

A backup file for the tile assets was found.

**File:**
- `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\frontend\src\assets\tiles.json.bak`

**Analysis:**
The content of this file is identical to `tiles.json`. Keeping backups with a `.bak` extension is a legacy practice that is not necessary when using a version control system like Git. This file is redundant.

**Recommendation:**
Delete this file.

### 2.3. Legacy Code and Documentation

A directory named `legacy` exists, containing what appears to be a previous version of the application.

**Directory:**
- `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\legacy\`

**Analysis:**
This directory contains `frontend` and `backend` subdirectories, as well as numerous Markdown files (`Charleston_Audit.md`, `TODO.md`, etc.) that seem to be outdated planning documents. The code within, such as `legacy/frontend/src/components/tiles/SpriteDebugger.tsx`, is not part of the current application structure. The entire directory appears to be obsolete.

**Recommendation:**
Delete the `legacy` directory and its entire contents.

## 3. Summary of Recommendations

- **Delete:**
  - `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\debug-engine3.js`
  - `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\debug-integration-test.js`
  - `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\test-debug.js`
  - `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\frontend\debug-test.html`
  - `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\frontend\src\assets\tiles.json.bak`
- **Delete Directory:**
  - `C:\Repos\american-mahjong-assistant\legacy\`
