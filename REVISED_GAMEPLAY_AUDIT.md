# Revised Gameplay Audit & Implementation Plan

## CORRECTIONS TO INITIAL AUDIT

Based on user feedback, here are the corrections to my initial assessment:

### ✅ ALREADY EXISTS AND WORKS WELL

1. **Wall Tile Counter** - EXISTS at `GameActionsPanel.tsx:90-92`
   - Shows "Wall: ## tiles remaining"
   - Used in `GameModeView.tsx` at lines 1267-1273
   - **User Request**: Move from bottom panel to TopZone, eliminate bottom panel

2. **Primary/Alternate Pattern Containers** - ALREADY LOOK GOOD
   - Located in `EnhancedIntelligencePanel.tsx:117-354`
   - ✅ Primary pattern with AI scores (line 224)
   - ✅ Progress bars (lines 231-249)
   - ✅ ##/14 tile counter with % (lines 189-220)
   - ✅ Top 5 alternate patterns display (lines 309-354)
   - ✅ Pattern visualizers with colorized tiles
   - ✅ "View All Patterns" button (lines 357-374)

3. **Pattern Swapping** - EXISTS (need to verify exact location)

### ❌ ACTUAL CRITICAL GAPS

Based on revised audit, here are the REAL issues:

## PRIORITY 1: USER-REQUESTED CHANGES

### 1. Move Wall Counter to TopZone ⭐ USER REQUEST
- **Current**: Wall counter in bottom `GameActionsPanel`
- **Needed**: Move to TopZone per spec format: "Wall: ## tiles remaining"
- **Action**: Eliminate GameActionsPanel entirely per user request

### 2. Missing Action Buttons in TopZone
- **Missing**: "Swap Joker" and "Dead Hand" buttons in TopZone
- **Current**: These exist in GameActionsPanel but need to move to TopZone

## PRIORITY 2: CORE GAMEPLAY FIXES

### 3. Game Control Panel for Solo Mode - COMPLETELY MISSING
- **Missing**: Entire Game Control Panel section
- **Needed**:
  - "Log Other Player Discard" with tile input modal
  - "Log Other Player Call" with tile input modal
  - "Undo Last Turn" functionality
  - Solo mode detection/special handling

### 4. Your Hand Zone Issues
- **Tile Lock/Unlock**: Missing padlock badge functionality
- **Tile count logic**: Verify 13/14 based on East player position
- **Draw Tile button**: Verify proper enabling rules

### 5. Missing Core Actions
- **Swap Joker**: Needs full implementation (dialog exists but not functional)
- **Dead Hand**: Not implemented
- **Call Tile**: Basic implementation but needs verification

## PRIORITY 3: POLISH & LAYOUT

### 6. Discard Pile Improvements
- **Tile organization**: Not organized by suit as specified
- **Tile overlap**: No overlapping for space efficiency
- **Call Tile prominence**: Needs improvement

### 7. Layout Order (per spec)
- Current order doesn't match specification
- Should be: TopZone → Game Control Panel → Your Hand → AI Co-Pilot → Exposed Tiles → Discard Pile
