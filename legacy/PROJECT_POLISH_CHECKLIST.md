## üìã Getting Started

1. **Choose a category** to focus on first
2. **Create specific issues** for each checklist item
3. **Test thoroughly** on multiple devices
4. **Document changes** and update this checklist
5. **Deploy incrementally** to avoid breaking changes

This checklist will evolve as we discover additional issues and improvements during the polish phase.
