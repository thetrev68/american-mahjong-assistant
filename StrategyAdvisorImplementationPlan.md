# American Mahjong Assistant - Strategy Advisor UI Revamp
## Complete Implementation Roadmap

### Overview
Transform the recommendations UI from technical data displays into an intuitive "Strategy Advisor" interface that adapts to gameplay phases and supports strategic decision-making during live physical games.

---

## Phase 1: Core Conversational Interface Foundation

### AI Development Prompt
```
You are working on the American Mahjong Assistant codebase. This is a React TypeScript app that helps players during physical mahjong games by providing intelligent tile and pattern recommendations.

CONTEXT:
- Current architecture: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + Tailwind CSS
- Main gameplay component: packages/frontend/src/features/gameplay/GameModeView.tsx (1,458 lines)
- Intelligence system: packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/
- Current problem: Technical data displays overwhelm users during fast-paced gameplay
- Goal: Create conversational AI interface that adapts to game phases

TASK: Replace the current PrimaryAnalysisCard.tsx with a new StrategyAdvisorPanel.tsx that:
1. Converts technical metrics to natural language
2. Detects game phase (early/mid/late/defensive) based on turn count, wall state, hand completion
3. Provides contextual advice that evolves with game state
4. Maintains all existing functionality while improving UX

FILES TO EXAMINE:
- packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/PrimaryAnalysisCard.tsx
- packages/frontend/src/stores/intelligence-store.ts
- packages/frontend/src/features/gameplay/GameModeView.tsx (lines 264-308)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep existing TypeScript interfaces
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Follow existing purple/blue design system
- Preserve all AI analysis functionality
- Add pull-to-refresh gesture (pull down to re-analyze)
- Include error handling for AI service failures
- Support keyboard navigation and ARIA roles for accessibility
```

### Technical Specifications

#### Core Type Definitions
```typescript
// Core game state types
type GamePhase = 'early' | 'mid-game' | 'late-game' | 'end-game' | 'defensive'
type StrategyMode = 'flexible' | 'quick-win' | 'high-score' | 'defensive'
```

#### New Components to Create
```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/StrategyAdvisorPanel.tsx
interface StrategyAdvisorPanelProps {
  analysis: HandAnalysis
  currentPattern: PatternRecommendation | null
  gamePhase: GamePhase
  onRefresh: () => Promise<void>
}

// packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/ConversationalSummary.tsx
interface ConversationalMessage {
  text: string
  confidence: number
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  type: 'insight' | 'warning' | 'suggestion' | 'defense'  // For visual treatments
  actionable: boolean
}

// packages/frontend/src/hooks/useGamePhaseDetection.ts
// Updated to accept strategy mode for more intelligent phase detection
function useGamePhaseDetection(strategyMode: StrategyMode): {
  phase: GamePhase
  confidence: number
  reasoning: string
}

// packages/frontend/src/hooks/usePullToRefresh.ts
function usePullToRefresh(onRefresh: () => Promise<void>): {
  pullDistance: number
  isRefreshing: boolean
  bindGesture: any
}

// packages/frontend/src/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts
// Accessibility hook for motion preferences
function useReducedMotion(): boolean
```

#### Store Updates (Zustand)
```typescript
// intelligence-store.ts - State additions
interface IntelligenceState {
  // Existing state...
  gamePhase: GamePhase
  strategyMode: StrategyMode
  conversationalSummary: ConversationalMessage | null
  isAnalyzing: boolean
  analysisError: string | null
}

// New Actions
generateConversationalSummary(analysis: HandAnalysis, phase: GamePhase, strategyMode: StrategyMode): ConversationalMessage
detectGamePhase(gameState: GameState, strategyMode: StrategyMode): GamePhase
setGamePhase(phase: GamePhase): void
setAnalysisError(error: string | null): void
setIsAnalyzing(loading: boolean): void

// New Selectors
const useGamePhase = () => useIntelligenceStore(state => state.gamePhase)
const useConversationalSummary = () => useIntelligenceStore(state => state.conversationalSummary)
const useAnalysisState = () => useIntelligenceStore(state => ({
  isAnalyzing: state.isAnalyzing,
  error: state.analysisError
}))
```

#### Basic Pattern Priority (Phase 1 MVP)
```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/utils/pattern-priority.ts
// Simple priority logic for Phase 1 (advanced logic moved to Phase 2)
function getBasicPatternPriority(pattern: Pattern, completion: number): PatternPriority {
  if (completion >= 80) return 'pursue'    // Green - nearly complete
  if (completion >= 50) return 'backup'    // Yellow - viable option
  if (completion >= 20) return 'risky'     // Red - challenging
  return 'dead'                           // Gray - unlikely
}
```

#### Components to Replace
- Remove: `PrimaryAnalysisCard.tsx`
- Replace with: `StrategyAdvisorPanel.tsx`
- Update: `GameModeView.tsx` lines 264-308 (intelligence panel integration)

#### Test Files to Create
- `StrategyAdvisorPanel.test.tsx`
- `ConversationalSummary.test.tsx`
- `useGamePhaseDetection.test.ts`
- `pattern-priority.test.ts`

#### Error Handling Requirements
```typescript
// StrategyAdvisorPanel.tsx must handle:
- AI service timeouts/failures
- Invalid game state data
- Network connectivity issues
- Graceful degradation to basic recommendations
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Carousel & Visual Priority System

### AI Development Prompt
```
You are continuing work on the American Mahjong Assistant Strategy Advisor revamp.

CONTEXT:
- Phase 1 completed: Conversational interface with game phase detection
- Current focus: Replace PatternRecommendations.tsx with swipeable carousel
- Goal: Traffic light priority system (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´âš«) with horizontal swipe navigation

TASK: Create a PatternCarousel component that:
1. Shows 3-5 pattern cards in horizontal swipeable layout
2. Uses color psychology for priority (green=pursue, yellow=backup, red=risky, gray=dead)
3. Calculates new "flexibility score" metric for pattern adaptability
4. Supports one-tap pattern switching
5. Shows contextual information based on game phase

FILES TO EXAMINE:
- packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/PatternRecommendations.tsx (current implementation)
- packages/frontend/src/stores/pattern-store.ts
- packages/frontend/src/ui-components/Card.tsx (design system)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Mobile-first touch interactions
- Smooth swipe animations
- Maintain existing pattern selection logic
- Add flexibility scoring algorithm
- Progressive disclosure (summary â†’ details)
- WAI-ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for screen readers
```

### Technical Specifications

#### New Components
```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/PatternCarousel.tsx
interface PatternCarouselProps {
  patterns: PatternCard[]
  onPatternSelect: (pattern: Pattern) => void
  onSwipe: (direction: 'left' | 'right') => void
}

// packages/frontend/src/features/intelligence-panel/PatternCard.tsx
interface PatternCard {
  pattern: Pattern
  priority: PatternPriority
  completion: number
  flexibility: number
  turnsEstimated: number
  tilesNeeded: TileRequirement[]
  conversationalAdvice: string
}

// packages/frontend/src/components/PriorityIndicator.tsx
type PatternPriority = 'pursue' | 'backup' | 'risky' | 'dead'
```

#### New Services
```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/services/FlexibilityAnalyzer.ts
function calculateFlexibilityScore(pattern: Pattern, availableTiles: Tile[]): number
function assignPatternPriority(pattern: Pattern, gameState: GameState): PatternPriority
function generateTileRequirements(pattern: Pattern, currentHand: Tile[]): TileRequirement[]

// Flexibility Score Calculation:
// Score = (number of possible tile combinations to complete pattern) / (rarity of required tiles)
// Range: 0-100, where higher scores = easier to adapt if board state changes
// Factors: tile availability in wall, alternative completion paths, joker usage efficiency
```

#### Components to Replace
- Remove: `PatternRecommendations.tsx`
- Replace with: `PatternCarousel.tsx`

## Phase 3: Gesture System Implementation

### AI Development Prompt
```
You are implementing the gesture system for the American Mahjong Assistant Strategy Advisor.

CONTEXT:
- Phases 1-2 completed: Conversational interface + pattern carousel
- Current focus: Add comprehensive gesture interactions
- Goal: Thumb-friendly mobile gestures for live gameplay

TASK: Implement gesture system with:
1. Pull-to-refresh on main game view (re-analyze hand)
2. Swipe gestures for pattern carousel navigation
3. Long-press on tiles for quick actions (keep/pass)
4. Smooth animations and haptic feedback

FILES TO EXAMINE:
- packages/frontend/src/features/gameplay/GameScreenLayout.tsx
- packages/frontend/src/ui-components/tiles/AnimatedTile.tsx
- packages/frontend/src/hooks/useGameIntelligence.tsx

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use react-spring for animations
- Add haptic feedback for iOS/Android
- Prevent gesture conflicts with existing touch handlers
- Full keyboard navigation support as fallback
- ARIA live regions for gesture feedback
```

### Technical Specifications

#### New Gesture Components
```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/components/gestures/PullToRefreshWrapper.tsx
interface PullToRefreshProps {
  onRefresh: () => Promise<void>
  threshold?: number
  children: React.ReactNode
}

// packages/frontend/src/hooks/useSwipeGestures.ts
function useSwipeGestures(onSwipe: (direction: SwipeDirection) => void): {
  bindGesture: any
  isAnimating: boolean
}

// packages/frontend/src/hooks/useHapticFeedback.ts
function useHapticFeedback(): {
  lightImpact: () => void
  mediumImpact: () => void
  heavyImpact: () => void
}
```

#### Integration Points
- Wrap `GameScreenLayout.tsx` with `PullToRefreshWrapper`
- Add swipe handlers to `PatternCarousel.tsx`

> **Note:** Long-press tile gestures moved to Phase 5 due to high risk of interaction conflicts with existing tile selection/dragging functionality. Focus first on non-conflicting gestures.

```

#### Store Updates
```typescript
// intelligence-store.ts additions
interface IntelligenceState {
  strategyMode: StrategyMode
  strategyAdvice: StrategyAdvice
  defensiveOpportunities: DefenseOpportunity[]
}

// New methods
setStrategyMode(mode: StrategyMode): void
